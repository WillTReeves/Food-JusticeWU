          <h3> Introduction</h3>
            <p>
              This chat is space for Willamette Students to share the location of free food on campus, this can be
              anything from cake to fresh produce. This is primarily to lessen food waste and is not intented to 
              provide people with a complete diet. If you consider yourself food insecure there are resources that
              can provide a more consistent and balnaced diet under the recourse page.

          <h3>Update</h3>
            <p>
              I was not able to complete this portion of the website with free hosting due to the limitaitons that a server-user connection has. 
              I hope to use this as a framework for ways that the website could be imporved. Despite the technical limitions that I dealt with on this 
              I belive that this is necessary tool that the Willamette community should adopt to lessen food waste and improve the food justice community.
