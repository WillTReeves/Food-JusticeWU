          <h3> Hunger in Oregon</h3>
          <p>
            Oregon has a food problem, over 400,000 Oregonians face food insecurity every year and more
            than 25% of them are children. Programs like Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program(SNAP)
            formerly food stamps provide support to over 28% of Oregon households. These programs provide
            food to people in need but don't address the root cause of hunger which is inequality. This is shown
            in the fact that Food insecurity disproportionately impacts communities of color, recent immigrants, 
            families with children, and particularly households led by single mothers, people with disabilities, 
            the LGBTQ community, and people in rural areas of Oregon. Providing food will help people but, without addressing the systemic root of the 
            hunger problem things will continue to get worse. Despite Oregon's hunger problem the organizations 
            working to end hunger are particularly open to addressing these root causes.

          <h3> Food Waste in Oregon </h3>
            <p>
              In the United States, there is more than enough food to go around. The problem is not a lack of food, 
              but food waste. In the United States, over 100 billion pounds of food is wasted which amounts to around
               40 percent of all food. Oregon is no different Oregonians throw away on average 2.3 pounds of food a week. A 
               significant majority of the food thrown away could have been eaten. Fruits and vegetables make up a large 
               portion of the waste as they go bad much quicker, especially when stored improperly. Despite this food, 
               insecure people have some of the most trouble getting fresh nutritious foods.

            <h3> Hunger On College Campuses</h3>
            <p>
              Despite food insecurity being extremely common on college campuses it largely goes unnoticed and unaddressed. 
              Prior to the pandemic, 30 percent of all college students identified as food insecure, as of fall 2020 this 
              number has shifted to 29 percent for 4-year students and 38 for two-year students. There is also a significantly
               higher rate of food insecurity for students of color. The pandemic caused colleges to limit or freeze many of 
               the food assistance programs they may have had this pared with the increase in unemployment created a large 
               number of new food-insecure students. Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits were extended 
               to include college-age students during the pandemic, however, this was temporary and will expire if no action is
                taken. The effect that food insecurity has on college students' success is significant, students are more likely
                 to have worse academic performance and deal with physical and mental health issues.
